\noindent A biometric system can be defined as a pattern recognition system that can recognize individuals based on the characteristics of their physiology or behaviour. One biometric technique for unintrusive identification is gait recognition which basically identifies people by the way they walk. In this study, we present an approach for gait recognition using Microsoft Kinect v2, a peripheral for the gaming console XBOX One, which provides us with marker less tracking of human motion in real time. We extract and evaluate a number of static and kinematic features and present the results of various classification algorithms for person identification. We were able to accomplish an accuracy of 93.75\% with eight test participants.
