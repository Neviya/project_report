\noindent The need for person Identification using biometric features has risen considerably during recent times. The reason being since biometric traits are part of the individual’s being, they are remarkably unique and can verify an individual’s identity with utmost accuracy. One biometric technique for unintrusive identification is gait recognition which basically identifies people by the way they walk. In former work, gait recognition is mainly achieved with camera systems. In this study, we present an approach for gait recognition using Microsoft Kinect V2, a peripheral for the gaming console XBOX One, which provides us with marker less tracking of human motion in real time. We extract and evaluate a number of static and kinematic features and present the results of various classification algorithms for person identification.
